            <h2>Maori Fishing Equipment</h2>
            <p>
                There were many tools that were used and sadly don't get made or used so much anymore. Te W훮nanga Whakairo has preserved some of the equipment they've used and made some more which you can see to the right. That long trap is for eels/tuna which there will be bait in the end and they go in just to get find out they can't turn back around, that trap is called a h카naki. The one hanging in the far back is for catching crayfish and there is also a t카toko ika which is Maori for hand net.

            <h2>Wooden Hand Clubs</h2>
            <p>
                Before Europeans and European weapons arrived in Aotearoa, M훮ori warfare mainly involved hand-to-hand combat. Warriors used many different hand weapons, including taiaha (fighting staffs), pouwhenua (pointed staffs), tewhatewha (axe-like staffs), tao (short spears), huata (long spears) and patu (clubs). The long weapons were carried, and the small clubs were often tucked into a belt. Special weapons were sometimes given names and passed down through generations. At the National Weaving school, students are taught the skills and traditions of a craft hundreds of years old.

            <h2>Cutlural Clothing</h2>
            <p>
                The image to the right is of a piupiu. Piupiu are cultural clothing significant to the Maori. They've been around pre-date European contact and have been estimated to date back to early 1900's. To this day they are still very significant and are used for ceremonies such as kapa haka. Piupiu are made from New Zealand flax and are processed by an elaborate method to create piupiu. This includes stripping the flax, twisted by a spinning method, boiled and then finally dried.
