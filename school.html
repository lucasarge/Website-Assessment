    <h2>National Carving School – Te Wānanga Whakairo</h2>
    <p>
        In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School began the task of learning the disciplines of their Māori ancestors. Among those students was Clive Fugill, the man who would become master carver of the institute today. “I’ll never forget that first day,” says Clive, “Our master carver, Hone Taiapa, looked at us all and said, “you are here to learn the art to pass it on to generations. Keep it alive for we could lose our identity.” It was exciting to be playing such an important role to save Māori art,” says Clive, “everyone has a reason in life. This was my reason. And that’s why I’m still here over 40 years later. If we lose our arts and crafts we lose our identity.” Today fulltime carving students study for three years at the national carving school, under the guidance of those, such as Clive Fugill and James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia who were once institute carving students themselves. The protruding tongue, as used in the haka (war dance), is intended as a symbol of defiance, determination and strength, however in many carvings it can also symbolize the oral nature in which information was passed on from generation to generation. Here at Te Puia we offer you the chance to take away traditional Māori carvings; beautiful handcrafted pieces made at our National Carving School. Look for the Te Puia Official Mark of Authenticity. We also accept carving commissions.

            <h2>Wood Carving</h2>
            <p>
                Since the first intake at Te Wānanga Whakairo, many young Māori from iwi (tribes) throughout New Zealand have been taught the Māori practice of wood carving under the expert guidance of master carvers who were once trainees at the school. In 1967, seven carving apprentices were selected from throughout the country to train under master carver Hone Te Kauru Taiapa – a student of the first Wānanga Whakairo. Part of that 1967 group are present day New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute master carvers, Clive Fugill and James Rickard.

            <h2>Bone, Stone and Pounamu Carving</h2>
            <p>
                At Te Takapū, students learn the revered tradition of carving pounamu (Nephrite-Jade/Greenstone), bone and stone. The school opened on 5 October 2009.The school was first led by Lewis Gardiner who is a well-regarded pounamu artist of his generation. Stacy Gordine, a renowned artist from the East Coast of New Zealand – and uri of Hone Te Kauru and Pine Taiapa – now leads the programme and is shaping the direction of the wānanga into the future. As of now applications are open to wahine commencing study in 2025. It is a very long enduring process.

            <h2>Weaving</h2>
            <p>
                At this school, male and female students have the honour of learning traditional Māori weaving techniques, as taught by experienced tutors. Tauira (students) within Te Rito learn the art and skills of traditional weaving, upholding the Māori tradition for future generations. Today, Te Rito is led by Tumu, Meleta Bennett- who was mentored by Emily Schuster’s daughter, Edna Pahewa. Edna was the Tumu of Te Rito for 18 years prior to Meleta’s appointment.  Through Edna’s influence, Meleta’s role as Tumu is ensuring the time-honoured art form lives.
